## Business Objective

The business objective is to enhance the efficiency of directed campaigns for long-term deposit subscriptions by minimizing contact volume. This will be achieved using a dataset from a Portuguese bank, encompassing 79,354 contacts across 17 campaigns conducted between May 2008 and November 2010. 

## Findings

A model has been defined that best infers the long-term deposit subscriptions with an accuracy of 91% and lift of 5.72. The factors that impact most positively are campaigns in the month of march, duration, consumer price index, and the feature that impacts most negatively is the employment variation rate. Taking into considerations these factors will improve long-term deposit subscriptions.
